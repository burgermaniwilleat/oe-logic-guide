Look at other blocks for a "template". Actual template will be posted later. 

Also, if possible get mkdocs installed and clone this repository so you can test the .md files you add locally.

if you have trouble installing it, ask chatgpt or something (im just as dum so don't ask me) ^^^

Not requiered though as it is easy to make the files and i can fix small errors if you don't have mkdocs up and running.
